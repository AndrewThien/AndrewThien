### Please find some of my projects below. :card_index_dividers:
#### Clean and readable code is what you can expect to see in these programs :sun_with_face:

1. [Task manager](https://github.com/AndrewThien/Task-manager)
- Task manager is a Python program for a small business that can help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of the team. Information about tasks and users will be shown and manipulated effectively by using this app.

2. [Inventory](https://github.com/AndrewThien/Inventory)
- Inventory is a Python program that was made for dealing with inventory management. Managers can use this program to search the product by its code, determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it, determine the product with the highest quantity, calculate the total value of each stock item.

3. [Your Language Lounge](https://github.com/AndrewThien/Your-Language-Lounge)
- This is my first website built using the Django framework. The website can be used as a promotion page for a language center with much information about their values, teachers, courses, etc. Also, there is a section containing English Learning materials and related posts. A small survey is included at the end of each material and this will enable users to know other users' opinions about the post.

4. [What to watch next?](https://github.com/AndrewThien/What-will-I-watch-next-)
- This project applies SpaCy - a Python NLP library - to recommend the movie to watch next based on the film desciptions and desciption of a film.
